## About The Project

<!-- Screenshot to come [![Screenshot of Dash][dash-screenshot]](link to listing on chrome store) -->
I love browsing TradeMe's One Dollar Listings, and I wanted a way to do that with a little less friction. So I created Dash, a browser extension that provides quick and easy access to those listings no matter what web page you're on.

I also took this project as an opportunity to build on my react and web dev skills, and learn new things such as:

* Publishing/Owning/managing a product
* Project configuration & architecture/structure
* Intentional/minimal inclusion of dependencies
* Accessibility
* OAuth flow
* Building reusable hooks
* Unit tests
* Tailwind CSS
* Typescript


### Built With

* [Preact](https://preactjs.com/)
* [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)


## Getting Started

The following will get you set up to work on the project:


### Prerequisites

I use [Volta](https://volta.sh/) to pin versions of node/yarn to ensure consistency between environments.


### Installation

1. Clone the repo
2. Install packages
   ```sh
   yarn
   ```
3. Register a test application for [TradeMe Sandbox](https://developer.trademe.co.nz/api-overview/registering-an-application/)
4. Enter your API details in a `.env` file at the root of the project - see `sample.env` for an example.


## Usage

There are a couple of scripts included in the project


### Start
To run a local dev server that watches your code for hot reload thanks to this Parcel [config](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@parcel/config-webextension)
```sh
  yarn start
```
And add the unpacked extension from the `dist` folder [here](chrome://extensions/)

### Build
To build for production run:
```sh
  yarn build
```
You can then pack the extension that was built in `dist/prod`
